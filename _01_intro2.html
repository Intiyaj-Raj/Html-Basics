            <pre>The Raven
                by Edgar Allan Poe
                Once upon a midnight dreary,
                While I pondered, weak and weary,
                Over many a quaint and curious
                Volume of forgotten lore—
                While I nodded, nearly napping,
                Suddenly there came a tapping,
                As of some one gently rapping,
                Rapping at my chamber door.
                "'T is some visitor," I muttered,
                "Tapping at my chamber door
                Only this and nothing more."
